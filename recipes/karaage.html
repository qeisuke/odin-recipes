    <p>Karaage (唐揚げ), or Japanese fried chicken, is a classic dish you can find at any Japanese home, bento lunch box, street-side stalls, restaurants, or diners. Come in bite-size nuggets, anyone who has tried the fried chicken can tell you how deliciously addicting it can be.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>680 g boneless, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 knob ginger </li>
      <li>1 clove garlic </li>
      <li>1/2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 Tbsp sake </li>
      <li>1/2 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>To prepare 680 g boneless, skin-on chicken thighs, cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Season with 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
      <li>Grate 1 knob ginger. Take 1/2 tsp grated ginger (for 4 servings) and its juices and add them to a large bowl. Next, mince or press 1 clove garlic (I love this garlic press) and add it to the bowl.</li>
      <li>Add 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 Tbsp sake, and 1/2 tsp roasted sesame oil to the bowl with the ginger and garlic. Whisk it all together.</li>
      <li>While the chicken is marinating, prepare the oil for deep-frying. Pour 960 ml neutral-flavored oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) and heat it to 325ºF (163ºC) on medium heat.</li>
      <li>While the oil is heating up, dredge the chicken. Prepare 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) and 2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch in separate piles. Lightly dredge a marinated chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge in the potato starch and remove the excess starch. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
      <li>Check that the oil temperature has reached 170ºC. When the oil is hot enough, gently submerge 3 to 5 chicken pieces in the oil at a time; do not overcrowd the pot. Deepfry until golden and cooked inside.</li>
    </ol>
